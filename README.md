If you are using a SQLite3 database, you will need both the database and player file.
If only the player file is passed, the format shown below will be used.

## Player file format

### Using a database
List of players IDs in the database.
```
1000
1001
...
1010
```

### Using only a text file
```
# Line starting with '#' is a comment

# Name | Defence Spike Serve Setting Saving Consistency

name1 | 1 2 3 4 5 5
name2 | 5 5 5 5 5 5
...
nameN | 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

### Banning player combinations
Ban player combinations using `!`.
All the players with names on the same line are banned with the first player on 
the line.
Use IDs if using a database; otherwise, use names.
```
!p1 - p2
!p3 - p4 - p5
```

Using `?`, you can ban all the player combinations on the line.
Every player on the line will be in different teams if possible.
```
?p1 - p2 - p3
```

### Forcing teammates
You can force teammates to be on the same team using `+`.
All the players connected are in the same team. Given `TEAM_SIZE` is the maximum 
amount of connected players.
```
+p6 - p7
+p7 - p8
+p9 - p10 - p11
```
