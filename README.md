### Banning player combinations
Ban player combinations using `!`. All the players with names on the same line are banned with the first player on the line.
```
!name1 - name2
!name3 - name4 - name5
```

Using `?`, you can ban all the player combinations on the line. Every player on 
the line will be in different teams if possible.
```
?name1 - name2 - name3
```

### Forcing teammates
You can force teammates to be on the same team using `+`. All the players connected are in the same team. Given `TEAM_SIZE` is the maximum amount of connected players.
```
+name6 - name7
+name7 - name8
+name9 - name10 - name11
```
